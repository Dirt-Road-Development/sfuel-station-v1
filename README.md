# sFUEL Station

The sFUEL Station is a community build project for the SKALE Network.
This codebase is the frontend with a couple of custom Proof-of-Work implementations for gas attainment.

The framework used is Create-React-App, resulting in a high level of bloat. Additionally, while component separated; the usage of state within the components can be better.
